Sanderling fork with additional API functionality for reading

- Added endpoint flag (`{"RunInVolatileProcessRequest":[{"ReadFromWindow": [{"windowId": "ID", "uiRootAddress": "ADR", "ParseText": "True/False"}]}]}` to retrieve text results from current client window;
- Removed periodic window focus;
